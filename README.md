- 👋 Hi, I’m @deejlucas
- 👀 I’m interested in time series forecasting with both machine learning and statistical models. I am also interested in experimental design in logistics and the gig economy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use machine learning models to control variance in experiments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that help me do the above.
